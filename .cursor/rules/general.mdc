# General Code Standards
- use Google-style docstrings
- add comprehensive documentation for each module and function


# Backend
- my python packages are installed in the root using poetry package manager
- the backend documentation file can be found at `backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`. Update this whenever you make a significant enough change to the backend code.


# Frontend
- using React 19 + TypeScript + Vite


# Terminal and general commands
- the token "&&" is not a valid seperator in my terminal version
- to run my backend: `poetry run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
- to run frontend (must be in /frontend dir): `npm run dev`
- for guidance on running testing, see `/TESTING_GUIDE.md`


# Additional Guidance
- TODO
