### High-level take
- **Overall**: The structure is decent and readable. There’s a clear split between `backend/` and `frontend/`, and the backend uses a sane modular layout with routers, models, schemas, and tests. The frontend uses React + Vite + TS with a standard `components/` + `pages/` layout. This is a good baseline.
- **But**: There are some non-trivial organizational gaps that would bite you as the project grows: missing ignore rules for large/binary content, no migrations, weak separation of backend layers, and lack of repo-level standards (tooling/CI/docs).

### What’s good
- **Backend modularity**: `routers/`, `models.py`, `schemas.py`, `database.py`, `auth/`, `tests/` are all familiar and easy to navigate.
- **Frontend clarity**: Components vs Pages and a dedicated `contexts/` dir is a reasonable starter structure.
- **Docs**: Presence of `RATE_LIMITING.md` and `CONTACT_SETUP.md` shows intent to document.

### Issues and recommended changes
- **Binary artifacts and vendor content in repo**
  - You have `frontend/node_modules/` and `backend/uploads/` present in the workspace snapshot. That’s a red flag.
  - Recommendation:
    - Add a top-level `.gitignore` that excludes `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`, and all upload/media directories. Also ignore Python caches and Vite cache.
    - Move `backend/uploads/` out of the repo or ensure it’s ignored. For production, use an object store (S3/Cloud Storage) or a mounted volume, not the repo.

- **Backend app layering could be cleaner**
  - Right now logic is likely mixed across `routers/`, `models.py`, and `schemas.py`.
  - Recommendation:
    - Restructure `backend/` into clearer layers:
      - `app/` (or keep `backend/`) with subpackages:
        - `api/` (routers, request/response schemas specific to API)
        - `core/` (settings, security, logging, error handling)
        - `db/` (database.py, session, connection, Alembic)
        - `models/` (ORM models, one file per entity)
        - `schemas/` (Pydantic models; separate request/response DTOs)
        - `services/` (business logic)
        - `repositories/` (data-access logic)
        - `auth/` (JWT/OAuth/password hashing)
        - `maintenance/` (admin/cron jobs)
        - `tests/` (mirrors structure above)
    - This separation enforces SOLID/DRY and makes growth manageable.

- **Migrations are missing**
  - `reset_db.py` is not a substitute for migrations.
  - Recommendation:
    - Add Alembic with env configured to your models.
    - Adopt migration workflows for schema changes; kill the reset script for anything but local nuking.

- **Configuration management**
  - `config.py` exists, but use robust settings management.
  - Recommendation:
    - Use Pydantic Settings (v2) for typed, layered config. Load from `.env`, env vars, and defaults.
    - Have separate env files or strategies per environment: `development`, `test`, `production`.

- **Security and secrets**
  - Ensure no secrets or tokens live in the repo. `.env_example.txt` exists, good; but unify naming and placement.
  - Recommendation:
    - Use `.env.example` at repo root (single canonical example).
    - Document required keys in `README.md`.

- **Testing coverage and structure**
  - Backend tests exist; frontend tests appear absent.
  - Recommendation:
    - Add frontend tests (`vitest` + `@testing-library/react`).
    - Mirror test structure to source structure for both sides.
    - Add minimal integration/E2E with Playwright for critical flows.

- **Repo-level standards/tooling**
  - Missing shared repo infra at root.
  - Recommendation:
    - Add root `README.md` with clear setup/run/test for both backend and frontend.
    - Add `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, optionally `SECURITY.md`.
    - Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with coding standards and commit conventions.
    - Add `pre-commit` hooks:
      - Backend: `ruff` (lint+format), `black` (if preferred), `mypy`.
      - Frontend: `eslint` and `prettier`.
    - Add CI (GitHub Actions):
      - Lint + test both backend and frontend on PR.
      - Optional: build and type-check frontend (`tsc --noEmit`).
    - Add dependabot or Renovate for dependency updates.

- **Containers and local dev DX**
  - Recommendation:
    - Add a `Dockerfile` for backend, and optionally for frontend.
    - Add `docker-compose.yml` with DB + backend (+ nginx if needed). Use volumes for data.
    - Add a `Makefile` or PowerShell scripts for common tasks (`make dev`, `make test`, `make lint`).

- **Backend domain structure and files**
  - `models.py` and `schemas.py` as single files will not scale.
  - Recommendation:
    - Split into per-entity files: `models/user.py`, `models/item.py`, etc.
    - Same for `schemas/` and `routers/` to keep files small and maintainable.
    - Create `exceptions.py` and unified error handlers in `api/dependencies` or `api/errors`.

- **Rate limiting**
  - You have `RATE_LIMITING.md` but I don’t see infra.
  - Recommendation:
    - Implement rate limiting at API gateway or app level (e.g., `slowapi` with Redis).
    - Document production settings and burst behavior.

- **Logging and observability**
  - Not visible here.
  - Recommendation:
    - Structured logging (JSON) with correlation IDs.
    - Request logging middleware.
    - Centralized config for log levels per env.
    - Health endpoints and basic metrics (Prometheus if relevant).

- **Frontend structure improvements**
  - Current layout is fine for small apps, but consider scale.
  - Recommendation:
    - Introduce a feature/route-based structure:
      - `features/collections/`, `features/items/` with `components/`, `hooks/`, `api/`, `types/` co-located.
    - Centralize API calls under `services/` or feature `api/` modules; avoid random `api.tsx` at root.
    - Add a `types/` dir for shared TS types.
    - Add absolute imports with TS path aliases and Vite aliases.
    - Add Prettier config and ensure ESLint + Prettier integration.
    - Add unit tests for components and hooks; smoke tests for pages.

- **Naming and consistency**
  - Use consistent file naming (kebab-case vs PascalCase). React components in `PascalCase.tsx` is fine, but keep CSS module naming consistent.
  - Keep consistency in auth naming between backend and frontend (e.g., token naming, storage keys) and put shared constants in one place.

- **Monorepo hygiene**
  - Consider adding a root `package.json` with workspace scripts (optional), or keep completely separate and ensure docs clarify how to run each side.
  - Ensure lockfiles are committed for both ecosystems (`poetry.lock`, `package-lock.json` already present—good).

### Concrete checklist (actionable)
- Add root `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `.env`, build artifacts, caches, and `uploads/`.
- Introduce Alembic migrations and remove reliance on `reset_db.py`.
- Restructure backend into `api/`, `core/`, `db/`, `models/`, `schemas/`, `services/`, `repositories/`, `auth/`, `tests/`.
- Split monolithic `models.py` and `schemas.py` into per-entity files.
- Add Pydantic Settings for config with `.env.example` at the repo root.
- Add CI: lint + test backend and frontend on PR, type-check frontend.
- Add pre-commit hooks (ruff/black/mypy, eslint/prettier).
- Add Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` for app + DB; use volumes for data and exclude from git.
- Add frontend tests with `vitest` and `@testing-library/react`.
- Consider feature-based frontend folders, path aliases, and a `services/` API layer.
- Add `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and optionally `SECURITY.md`.
- Implement rate limiting with Redis and document it (to match `RATE_LIMITING.md`).
- Add structured logging and request logging middleware on the backend.

If you want, I can draft the `.gitignore`, skeleton backend layout, Alembic setup, and CI workflows next.
